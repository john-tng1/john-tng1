My name is John and I work as a Tech Support Engineer in Consumer Electronics.

#### About me

- Electronics Repair and Manufacturing with 6 years of professional experience

- Loves working with numbers, making process diagrams, solving technical/business problems, and learning new skills. I self-taught myself SQL, Python and Machine Learning techniques
  
#### Skills and Tools

- Tools: SQL (PostgreSQL), Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib), Excel (Vlookup, PowerQuery) ReactJS
- Skills: Web Development, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualisation, Machine Learning skills

#### Currently Learning

This is based on the curriculum from Daniel Bourke - an inspiring Machine Learning Engineer and writer. These are Coursera's Specilisations which helping me to become a Machine Learning Engineer.

- **[Learning How to Learn Course](https://dbourke.link/coursera-learning-how-to-learn)** â€” If I'm going to be learning online, I might as well learn how to learn.
- **[Python for Everybody Specialization](https://dbourke.link/coursera-python)** â€” A large amount of machine learning and data science is done in Python. But before I start writing data science code, I'll need to get familiar with the Python programming language.
- **[Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)** â€” After going through the Python for Everybody Specialization, my next move should be to start writing data science specific code with Python.
- **[Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning)** â€” The Applied Data Science with Python taught me how to visualize and manipulate data, now it's time to find out how to find patterns in it using machine learning algorithms.
- **[Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning)** â€” All of the code I'll be writing triggers mathematics under the hood. In order to understand what's happening behind the scenes, I'll go through the Mathematics for Machine Learning specialization.

#### Certification

- Google Data Analytics Certificate, [issued by Coursera in July 2021](https://www.credly.com/badges/5abaf8af-10d5-44cd-90bc-6fd9a3831cd2)
